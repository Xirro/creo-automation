Audit reports

This directory contains npm audit snapshots moved from the repository root.

Policy
- Audit reports are generated by CI (`.github/workflows/npm-audit.yml`) and uploaded as artifacts for each run.
- The JSON snapshots contained here are historical records and may be used for compliance or manual review.
- Filenames follow: npm-audit-after-<action>.json or npm-audit-<version>-<sha>-<timestamp>.json

How to generate locally
```powershell
$ver = (Get-Content package.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json).version
$sha = git rev-parse --short HEAD
$ts = (Get-Date).ToString('yyyyMMddTHHmmss')
npm audit --json > "docs/audit/CreoAutomation-audit-$ver-$sha-$ts.json"
```

CI
- The GitHub Actions workflow `npm-audit.yml` runs on push and PRs to `main` and uploads `npm-audit.json` as an artifact for the run.

Note: If you prefer to rely entirely on CI artifacts, remove historical files from this folder and rely on the Actions artifacts view instead.
